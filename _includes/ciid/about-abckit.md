### ABCKit

ABCKit is an educational app for iPhone and iPad, based on the [Montessori Methodology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_education) to teach kids between 2 and 5 years the letters in multiple languages.

I developed the app from start to finish. Based on the wireframes provided by [Arquinauta](http://arquinauta.es/) I wrote all the drawing interactions, the code for including new languages in a flexible way and the final packaging and distribution to the App Store.
