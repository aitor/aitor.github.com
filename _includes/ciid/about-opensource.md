### Open Source

Throughout my career, I've been an active member of the Open Source community. Here are some of the open source projects I've created:

* [acts\_as\_scribe](https://github.com/linkingpaths/acts_as_scribe) A rails plugin that allows to keep track of the users activity.
* [alea](https://github.com/linkingpaths/alea) A ruby gem that aim to bring some aleatory behavior to ruby Kernel.
* [meta_tags](https://github.com/linkingpaths/meta_tags) A rails plugin that gives you control over the xhtml meta tags.
