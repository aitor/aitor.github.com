## Why me?

Learning by doing.

The CIID  Summer School 2012 mini-site says that the Institute follows this philosophy. Me too.

I've been writing code for a living for more than 14 years and one of the things I've learnt in this time, is that no matter how beautiful, ugly, complex or simple the inner workings of a technology are, what defines our behavior is the interactions [we shape on it](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan#Understanding_Media_.281964.29).

I want to learn to create better interactions, better experiences, different experiences and I'm prepared to apply that new knowledge to my work. In fact,  I've come to the conclusion that I will not be able to create great products or services in the next years without having a better knowledge of how great interactions are created.

I think that my previous experience in some areas like development, marketing or management can be useful to create a balanced group in the Summer School and I'll be happy to share what I know at the same time I learn in new areas.

Five years ago I cofounded [Linking Paths](http://www.linkingpaths.com), a web company obsessed with creating [simple and useful](http://www.stagehq.com) web applications. I've learnt [a lot of things](http://www.linkingpaths.com/fiveyearsago/) in this time, but I refuse to be only one thing. I'm not happy being "a developer" anymore; the tag has become constraining, dehumanizing. I refuse to accept a monochrome version of myself that spans my interests or capabilities only to a few areas.

[Specialization is for insects](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein), and I want to be a human.

Absurdly in love with high quality, long lasting products, I cofounded [Jositajosi](http://jositajosi.etsy.com) with [my wife](http://flavors.me/bego) in 2009, a small company that makes awesome sleeves for that shiny gadgets you carry with you everywhere.

Our society is becoming software-based and, as consequence, a few years ago I founded [Pro Bono Publico](http://probp.org), the main advocate of [Open Data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) in Spain and organizer of [AbreDatos](http://www.abredatos.es/), a 48h hackaton to develop open source public services.

Born in that small, beautiful corner of the world called [Basque Country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_Country_\(greater_region\)), I'm currently living in [Reykjav√≠k](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reykjav%C3%ADk), Iceland, where I keep marvelling at how awesome my wife is, how short is our life and how full of challenges the World is these days.
