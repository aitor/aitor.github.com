### Jositajosi

Absurdly in love with high quality, long lasting products, I cofounded [Jositajosi](http://jositajosi.etsy.com) in 2009, a small company that makes awesome sleeves for that shiny gadgets you carry with you everywhere.

Building on top of a original logo made for us by [La Personnalit√©](http://lapersonnalite.com/) I've been in charge for design and copywriting of all kind of marketing and graphic material:

* Personal mailing for customers
* Letterpressed Xmas
* Banners for workshops,
* [Promotional videos](https://vimeo.com/14839288)
