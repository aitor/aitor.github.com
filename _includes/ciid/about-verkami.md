### Verkami

Verkami is the leading  [crowdfunding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_funding) platform in Spain, focused on helping creative projects become reality, with nearly 300 projects funded in his first year.

In a relationship that continues today, I created all the backend and frontend code of [verkami.com](http://www.verkami.com/change_lang?lang=en). This include payment gateway integrations, multilanguage support, a highly scalable platform,  [CDN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) support, etc.

With an original design created by [Vostok](http://www.vostokstudio.com/), these days I'm the main designer for the new features in the platform.
