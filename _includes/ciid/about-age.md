### The Age Of Fiction

Using the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">Internet Movie Database</a> as datasource, Age of Fiction generates a new chronology based on the fictional time elapsed since we started creating movies.

I wrote a software called Bergman that periodically downloads, cleans and parses the data, computes the total length of all films ever made and calculates the current fictional "speed of time".

With this information Bergman transfer the current "Age of Fiction" to an Arduino device that displays the date in an accessible
dd/mm/yyyy format.
