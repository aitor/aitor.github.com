That murmur.

Can you hear it? In the beginning it was an inaudible utterance, like a group of people speaking at a distance. But has been **growing for years**, louder and louder all the time. Now, sometimes it's so loud I can barely think… I can't focus, I can't rest.

Sometimes it's like a electric buzz… the rumor of servos and engines revolving at incredible speeds. Swarms of über-cheaps drones flying together in complex formations while the software installed in a remote computer controls their movements. I can imagine the lines of code running on their tiny brains, dutifully adjusting their destination to 64.150596,-21.956474. I can **almost understand** what they trying to tell me.

But the murmur becomes unintelligible again. It grows into a deafening humming of new, strange interactions: a mess of machines printing another machines, of software embodied in things that are not computers, of public spaces that are not passive containers anymore, of digital ghosts leaking into reality… Oh God, **if only the noise wasn't so loud**.

But more than anything else, that noise is the sound of a wall collapsing in front of us. It's the tremor of the digital and physical tectonic plates shifting, creating new mountains and valleys packed with the children of a new aesthetic that we are still creating. **How can we interact with them?** How can we talk with them? Do they even need us?

For a long time it was pretty clear that the software we were creating was made by lines of code, that the context for using it was that screen in front of us -the PC- and that the users of our work were very much other human beings.

Now I look around me and I have no idea what anything is or does anymore. Software **is the mythological hydra turned digital**, turned invisible, turned ubiquitous, turned anything and everything, anywhere and everywhere. The way software is constantly permeating through our society, our culture, our civilization is much deeper than what we used to think. The murmur will not stop.

I would like to attend CIID Summer School **to understand** that murmur.
