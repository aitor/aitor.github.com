This is our home.

The apartment is perfectly situated on Vesturbaer, only a 10 minute walk from Downtown Reykjavík. Calm and quiet to relax during the nights but close to the city center to join Reykjavik's day activities & great night life. The apartment is situated next to the coast so a nice morning stroll along the shoreline to begin the day is a very nice option… You won't find a better location in Reykjavík!

It's a warm, cozy, bright and spacious flat. The space is dominated by a large living room where you will find a big dinning table and vintage nordic style chairs should you wish to invite some of your new icelandic friends for dinner. You'll find too two smaller desktops that we use as home offices and some shelves containing our books that include a nice selection of philosophy, tech and short stories. Additionally you have a sofa that can also be used for sleeping, increasing the apartments capacity to four people.

From the living room you can access a balcony with views to a nice private little patio. The balcony is perfect for drinking your morning coffee, sip some malt whiskey in the afternoon, watch the northern lights comfortably or just relax for a while if the weather is good. Connected with the living room via a small hall you will find our large bedroom that contains a king size bed and next to it a warm and nice toilet with shower and a big mirror.

**We love [to cook](http://sumendi.is)** and, therefore, you'll find a well-equipped kitchen with all kind of appliances. Feel free to use any tool or condiment that you find in it and if you cook something nice... send us a photo!

As a developer I work very often from home and that means that I need a reliable and fast connection. We'll provide that wifi connection to you so you skype with your friends or need to check your email (but we suggest you to disconnect for a few days :). The laundry room is in the basement and you can use the washing machine & dryer (everything in the same machine) for free. Of course towels and bed linen are included as any other thing (iron, shampoo, shower gel, etc) used in daily life.

Nice guests are more than welcome to use our home as if it was theirs. You don't need to buy salt, washing powder or the legion of commodities that we all need when in holidays. You'll find everything at our home... after all this is not a souless holiday let or a summer second house. Welcome to your new icelandic home away from home.
