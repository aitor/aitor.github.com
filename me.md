Aitor García Rey writes code, designs and helps managing [Linking Paths](http://www.linkingpaths.com), a web company obsessed with creating [simple and useful](http://www.stagehq.com) web applications. But he refuses to be only one thing. He is not happy being "a developer" anymore; the tag has become constraining, dehumanizing. He refuses to accept a monochrome version of himself that spans his interests or capabilities only in a few areas.

[Specialization is for insects](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein), and he wants to be a human.

Absurdly in love with high quality, long lasting products, he cofounded [Jositajosi](http://jositajosi.etsy.com) in 2009, a small company that makes awesome sleeves for that shiny gadgets you carry with you everywhere.

Our society is becoming software based and, as consequence, he founded [Pro Bono Publico](http://probp.org), the main advocate of [Open Data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) in Spain and organizer of [AbreDatos](http://www.abredatos.es/), a 48h hackaton to develop open source public services.

He telegraphs [140 chars](http://twitter.com/_aitor) messages too often, publishes [grainy images](http://www.flickr.com/photos/aitorgarcia) in the web, maintains a digital [commonplace book](http://collecting.aitor.is) and will be happy to answer your [emails](mailto:hello@aitor.is) (it can take a while).

Born in that small, beautiful corner of the world called [Basque Country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_Country_\(greater_region\)), Aitor García Rey has been recently in Copenhaguen [learning about Interaction Design](/a-ciid-alumni) with a group of incredible people in [CIID Summer School 2012](http://ciid.dk/education/summer-school/summer-school-2012). Now he is back in [Reykjavík](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reykjav%C3%ADk), Iceland, where he is actually living and marvelling at how awesome his wife is, how short is our life and how full of challenges the World is these days.
