Clarke's Three Laws are three "laws" of prediction formulated by the British writer Arthur C. Clarke. They are:
* When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.
* The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.
* Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.


*
* When exposed to the massive possibilities open by new research fields it's impossible to know what is impossible.
* Any futuristic fabulation based in technology is indistinguishable from present.
