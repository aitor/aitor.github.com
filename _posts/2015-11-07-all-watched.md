A friend of mine is starting Computer Science in college. She is learning to code in Java and is experiencing the transfixing feeling of commanding machines for first time. I remember perfectly the thrill, and even feel it still sometimes, although now it's indissolubly connected with a cynical perspective on the software industry. But I digress.

Yesterday we were talking about the courses she is taking right now and she mentioned Operating Systems. I mentioned that it's an amazing topic from a technical point of view but instantly sidetracked the conversation to my favourite angle on this area: the folklore and history of Unix and the creation of the Personal Computer during the 60-70s.

She mentioned that it would be great to read more about it, so I checked my Kindle library and refreshed my memories to share what I've read, watched and found interesting on this area. I guess it will interesting to share it here for other people that maybe interested. Without more preamble, the list:

- The part 2 of [All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/All_Watched_Over_by_Machines_of_Loving_Grace_(TV_series)#/Part_2._.27The_Use_and_Abuse_of_Vegetational_Concepts.27). You will be introduced to some of the foundational characters Cybernetics, Networks and Systems theory, in a broad perspective. The whole series is worth watching though.

- This is one of the key names in the philosophy behind the Californian ideology that shaped the dawn of the PC and the operating systems. The history of [Stewart Brand](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stewart_Brand) and the Whole Earth Catalog.

- [Markoff](https://twitter.com/markoff) is a great witness of this era:

- And if you like Markoff he just published a new book I'm reading now on the actual state of AI and automation and how self-driving Teslas can be traced back to the old Augmenting-Humans VS. AIs-should-be-in-charge confrontation:

- The mother of all Demos will blow your mind. The name is not gratuitous grandiosity. For many of us this is the foundational moment that defined what is a PC.

- Especially when you read about [its context](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos) and who was the camera operator :).

- More on the valley's society on the 60s and its connection with the creation of the Internet and the clash of Mainframe Crewcuts with the PC hippies:

- And finally another key name in this story: Xerox PARC, where they created every modern implementation of Engelbart's ideas just to fail miserably at selling these ideas to the Corporation:

- Stephenson is always great, and this is good short intro to what happened next: Microsoft, Apple, Linux et al.

- And finally –although it should be probably the first on this list– a 30-years-earlier prologue on the minds of those that made everything possible:
