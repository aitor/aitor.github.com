title: Osotu, another way of learning is possible - On Key Competences and Skills

I've recently had the opportunity to attend a training course for teachers. But some context first.

As I have [mentioned before](https://aitor.is/writing-on/atlas) Atlas didn't attend any formal education for the first three years of his life. He started at school on what the Spanish system call "Infantil" (akin to Pre-K/K in US) and at that moment we chose what we thought would a good school for him. Long story short, after three years we were very conviced of a) what they sold us when we first signed up Atlas in that school was not true and b) the real system and approach they use was 100% traditional and not very fitted for Atlas.

We then decided to change schools -and had a few very dramatic hours after telling Atlas we were doing so ðŸ˜…- and pick a new model that would be a better fit for him. After much research we found [Osotu](https://osotu.org/), a private school not far from Barakaldo, that followed a very different learning model. We instantly liked the approach and decided to make a double bet on Osotu: trust Atlas education to them and do it in a moment where their financial sustainability was in question. He is now close to finish the first year in Osotu and we couldn't be happier with the result of the bet.

Recently I became aware of opportunity to attend a training course for teachers that Osotu is running internally to reach new potential candidates. Not being professionally a teacher I first hesitated about if I would make sense for me but at the same time I felt in my guts that there would be many conections and parallelisms with the responsabilities a person that leads technical teams has. Boy, was I right.

During the session I constantly found point of views and principles that we valuable for any working in a team, specially if the raw material of your work is knowledge, as it happens on software development and startups. Here are some notes on the first session of the first module.


## Three Cs: Capacidades, Competencias, CorazÃ³n (Skill, Competences, Heart)

Osotu learning approach is mostly adapted from [Mar Romera](https://integratek.es/mar-romera/) "three Cs" model that succintly could be described as a way to learn that is focused on 3 different aspects of the students:

- The innate **skills** they have.
- The **competences** they develop through the learning process.
- The catalyzer passion, desire and a good disposition provides to the previous two (the **heart**)

There a few key principles of this model that I found relevant:

- It's a model not a methodology. Translation for the tech readers: this is [Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/), not [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-scrum-module). The reason is the same we see in technology: you can accomodate a diverse team in your very specific context with an off-the-self methodology that details who, how and when is fitted to do what. Eventually those methodologies become more constraining than inspiring.

- It's rooted on **social constructivism**. Before Atlas was schooled I tried to learn more about the different theories of learning and came in contact with the work [Jean Piaget](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Jean_Piaget) (most probably by his connection with the popular Montessori system) that basically says that an education is not something that is _given_ fully formed to you but on the contrary something **you actively build** yourself in an unique by connecting the pieces that are presented to you. What I didn't was that Piaget's work was extended to something called **social constructivism** by pyscologist [Lev Vygotsky](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lev_Vygotsky) that -probably very influenced by the soviet era- put the focus on how that building process is heavily influnced by your interactions with other students, their culture, and society at large. It looks logic to me.

- Transversal learning. The -seemingly obvious- idea that the learning process hardly happens on a silo. Not being able of tracing the influence of economics in history, philosophy in politics, or maths in music is a diservice to our kids and a byproduct of a industrial approach to education.

- Diversity as opportunity. This connects very well with the idea of learning through interactions with other people, acknowledging the limitations we all have in most aspects and honoring them with empathy and humbleness.

Then it came a section on skills and competences and for a developer like me two of those core tenants provided immediate parallelisms:

- Skills == Hardware
- Competences == Software.

Hardware is mostly rigid, fixed and purpose-agnostic. Any hardware, as powerful as it may be, will have limitations, constraints and charactheristic that will make it specially fitted for some uses. Knowing and understading those limitations, and focusing on the characteristics at what they excel is key to make a good use of the hardware. Sometimes if we are creative enough we may find that a hardware that was designed with an initial usecase is very good for another one, as we see now with [GPU](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Graphics_processing_unit)s. Initially designed to compute the simple graphics on your know monitor they are now incredibly expensive and [bought by the tens of thousands to build AI models](https://engineering.fb.com/2024/03/12/data-center-engineering/building-metas-genai-infrastructure/).

Students skills are not different.

We have innate abilities in some areas but _hardly on all areas_. How good were Einstein, Dirac or Bohr at playing football, making strategies or leading teams? Moreso, how pointless -and unfair- is to look at students from that perspective? Demanding all the same things to all different people? So the idea here is to focus on the natural strengths of each person while helping to improve the weaknesses we all posses.

Software is fluid. Is a goo. It [devours everything](https://a16z.com/why-software-is-eating-the-world/). It's usually purpose-specific but composed of many different pieces (languages, stacks, libraries, etc.) Developing software is hard and feels like a moving target but when it works, boy, it's good. Good software leverages other tools to acquire new capabilities faster and more efficiently. Good software maximizes the hardware it's run on (see the connection?). Good software is supported by abstract layers that can be rebuilt, improved, transformed. Software is transversal by definition: it supports your countless hours in TikTok, the life support of astronauts in the [ISS](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/International_Space_Station), and the very words that your inner voice is reading inside your head now.

Students competences are not different.

If we do our work well, competences allow students to perform great tasks and become a toolbox that they can use in daily life to solve problems... and those problems are almost invariably transversal problems, creative problems. teamwork problems, efficiency problems, risk-taking problems. I was extremely happy to learn that one of the techniques that should be promoted in Osotu to develop this competences is the [socratic method](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Socratic_method) because [I'm a big fan](https://aitor.is/writing-on/2022-asking-together). I couldn't stop thinking about the very famous -at least for us developers- example of [teaching binary to 9yo students](https://web.archive.org/web/20240215133857/https://www.garlikov.com/Soc_Meth.html) and the natural interestingness it shows in students.

We wrap up the session by watching this

Next session will be about the last 'C' (the Heart) and will deal I think with one of the more clearly neglected areas in education: passion, emotions and desires. Let's see!
